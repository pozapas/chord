# OD Matrix Chord Diagram Generator
This repository contains code to visualize Origin-Destination (OD) matrices using a chord diagram. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) for data processing and visualization, as well as a Streamlit app for interactive web-based representation of the chord diagram.

## Key Features:
- *Interactive Chord Diagram:* Offers a clear and intuitive way to understand the flow and magnitude between different origins and destinations in the OD matrix.

- **Streamlit Web App:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their OD matrix data and generate visualizations on the fly.

- **Flexible Data Input:** Supports various formats for inputting the OD matrix, ensuring compatibility with different data sources.

- **Customizable Visuals:** Parameters can be adjusted to modify the appearance and layout of the chord diagram to better match the dataset's specifics.
