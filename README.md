# OD Matrix Chord Diagram Generator
This repository contains code to visualize Origin-Destination (OD) matrices using a chord diagram. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) for data processing and visualization, as well as a Streamlit app for interactive web-based representation of the chord diagram.

Key Features:
- *Interactive Chord Diagram:* Offers a clear and intuitive way to understand the flow and magnitude between different origins and destinations in the OD matrix.

- *Streamlit Web App:* Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their OD matrix data and generate visualizations on the fly.

- *Flexible Data Input:* Supports various formats for inputting the OD matrix, ensuring compatibility with different data sources.

- *Customizable Visuals:* Parameters can be adjusted to modify the appearance and layout of the chord diagram to better match the dataset's specifics.

Usage:
1- Jupyter Notebook: Run the notebook to process your OD matrix data and generate the chord diagram. The notebook contains detailed annotations and step-by-step procedures to guide you.

2- Streamlit App: Launch the Streamlit app locally to interactively visualize your OD matrix using the chord diagram. Follow the provided instructions to upload your data and adjust visualization parameters.
